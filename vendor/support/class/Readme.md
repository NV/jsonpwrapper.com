# Class.js

  High performance classical inheritance for **node.js**.

## Installation

  Install the [Kiwi package manager for nodejs](http://github.com/visionmedia/kiwi)
  and run:
  
      $ kiwi -v install class

## About Class.js

Without wasting performance on cross-browser functionality,
class.js is an **extremely light** (_10-ish SLOC_) class implementation.

By utilizing idiomatic prototypal inheritance techniques this
implementation is **very fast**. There is no wrapping or _super_ 
hacks involved.

## Examples

    var Class = require('class').Class

    var User = new Class({
      constructor: function(name){
        this.name = name
      },
      toString: function(){
        return '[User ' + this.name + ']'
      }
    })
    
    var Admin = User.extend({
      extend: { name: 'Admin' },
      constructor: function(name) {
        User.call(this, name.toUpperCase())
      }
    })
    
    puts(new Admin('tj'))
    // => "[User TJ]"
    
    puts(Admin.name)
    // => "Admin"
    
## Benchmarks

Currently the benchmarks compare regular **prototypal inheritance**,
node's **sys.inherits()**, and **class.js**. Each subclasses _User_
as _Admin_, and creates an instance **500,000 times**.

    Î»  class.js: node benchmark.js

    running 500000 times

    prototype : 68 ms
    sys.inherits() : 1512 ms
    class.js : 1531 ms

## Running Tests

Specs are written using [JSpec](http://jspec.info), however
no additional installations are required as JSpec is froozen
to _spec/lib_, just simply run:

    $ make test
